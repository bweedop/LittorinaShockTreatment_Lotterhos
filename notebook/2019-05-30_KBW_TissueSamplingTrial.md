## Tissue Sampling via Ethanol submersion

It was suggested that submersing the snails in 70% ethanol would cause the snails to emerge from their shells and therefore avoid pulling the tissue out forcefully with forceps. I tested this method with a few snails and it did not work. It caused snails to draw up even further into their shells.

I tested additional, different concentrations (25%, 50% and 95%) of ethanol as well with no success.

## Tissue Sampling using Forceps

I tested the reliability and efficiency of removing snails from shells with forceps by simply pulling them gently out of the shell. It was not as effective as one might think and it was not reliable at all. Someone with experience might be able to remove snails from shells more effectively and reliably but it does not seem like a reliable method for most.
